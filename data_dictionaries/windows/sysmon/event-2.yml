description: The change file creation time event is registered when a file creation
  time is explicitly modified by a process.
details: 'The change file creation time event is registered when a file creation time
  is explicitly modified by a process. This event helps tracking the real creation
  time of a file. Attackers may change the file creation time of a backdoor to make
  it look like it was installed with the operating system. Note that many processes
  legitimately change the creation time of a file; it does not necessarily indicate
  malicious activity.[Sysmon Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon#event-id-2-a-process-changed-a-file-creation-time)
