description: The image loaded event logs when a module is loaded in a specific process.
details: "The image loaded event logs when a module is loaded in a specific process.\
  \ This event is disabled by default and needs to be configured with the \u2013l\
  \ option. It indicates the process in which the module is loaded, hashes and signature\
  \ information. The signature is created asynchronously for performance reasons and\
  \ indicates if the file was removed after loading. This event should be configured\
  \ carefully, as monitoring all image load events will generate a large number of\
  \ events.[Sysmon Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon#event-id-7-image-loaded)\n"
