description: This event logs when a named file stream is created.
details: "This event logs when a named file stream is created, and it generates events\
  \ that log the hash of the contents of the file to which the stream is assigned\
  \ (the unnamed stream), as well as the contents of the named stream. There are malware\
  \ variants that drop their executables or configuration settings via browser downloads,\
  \ and this event is aimed at capturing that based on the browser attaching a Zone.Identifier\
  \ \u201Cmark of the web\u201D stream.[Sysmon Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon#event-id-15-filecreatestreamhash)\n"
