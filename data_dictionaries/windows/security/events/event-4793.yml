description: The Password Policy Checking API was called
details: "This event generates each time the Password Policy Checking API is called.\n\
  The Password Policy Checking API allows an application to check password compliance\
  \ against an application-provided account database or single account and verify\
  \ that passwords meet the complexity, aging, minimum length, and history reuse requirements\
  \ of a password policy.\n* This event, for example, generates during Directory Services\
  \ Restore Mode (DSRM) account password reset procedure to check new DSRM password.\n\
  * This event generates on the computer where Password Policy Checking API was called.\n\
  Note that starting with Microsoft SQL Server 2005, the \u201CSQL Server password\
  \ policy\u201D feature can generate many 4793 events on a SQL Server.\n[MS Source](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/blob/master/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4793.md)\n"
