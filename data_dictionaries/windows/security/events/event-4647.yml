description: User initiated logoff
details: "This event is generated when a logoff is initiated. No further user-initiated\
  \ activity can occur. This event can be interpreted as a logoff event.\n* The main\
  \ difference with \u201C4634(S): An account was logged off.\u201D event is that\
  \ 4647 event is generated when logoff procedure was initiated by specific account\
  \ using logoff function, and 4634 event shows that session was terminated and no\
  \ longer exists.\n* 4647 is more typical for Interactive and RemoteInteractive logon\
  \ types when user was logged off using standard methods. You will typically see\
  \ both 4647 and 4634 events when logoff procedure was initiated by user.\n[MS Source](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/blob/master/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4647.md)\n"
