  * The main difference between \u201C4647: User initiated logoff.\u201D and 4634\
  \ event is that 4647 event is generated when logoff procedure was initiated by specific\
  \ account using logoff function, and 4634 event shows that session was terminated\
  \ and no longer exists.\n* 4647 is more typical for Interactive and RemoteInteractive\
  \ logon types when user was logged off using standard methods. You will typically\
  \ see both 4647 and 4634 events when logoff procedure was initiated by user.\n[MS\
