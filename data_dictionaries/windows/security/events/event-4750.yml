description: A security-disabled global group was changed
details: "This event generates every time security-disabled (distribution) global\
  \ group is changed.This event generates only on domain controllers.\nSome changes\
  \ do not invoke a 4750 event, for example, changes made using the Active Directory\
  \ Users and Computers management console in Managed By tab in group account properties.\n\
  If you change the name of the group (SAM Account Name), you also get \u201C4781:\
  \ The name of an account was changed\u201D if \u201CAudit User Account Management\u201D\
  \ subcategory success auditing is enabled.\nIf you change the group type, you get\
  \ a change event from the new group type auditing subcategory instead of 4750. If\
  \ you need to monitor for group type changes, it is better to monitor for \u201C\
  4764: A group\u2019s type was changed.\u201D\n[MS Source](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/blob/master/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4750.md)\n"
