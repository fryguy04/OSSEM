  \ a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This can occur when a domain controller\
  \ doesn\u2019t have a certificate installed for smart card authentication (for example,\
  \ with a \u201CDomain Controller\u201D or \u201CDomain Controller Authentication\u201D\
  \ template), the user\u2019s password has expired, or the wrong password was provided.\
  \ This event generates only on domain controllers. This event is not generated if\
  \ \u201CDo not require Kerberos preauthentication\u201D option is set for the account.\n\
