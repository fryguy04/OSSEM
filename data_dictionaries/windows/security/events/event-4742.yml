description: A computer account was changed
details: "This event generates every time a computer object is changed.\n* This event\
  \ generates only on domain controllers.\n* You might see the same values for Subject\\\
  Security ID and Computer Account That Was Changed\\Security ID in this event. This\
  \ usually happens when you reboot a computer after adding it to the domain (the\
  \ change takes effect after the reboot).\n* For each change, a separate 4742 event\
  \ will be generated.\n* Some changes do not invoke a 4742 event, for example, changes\
  \ made using Active Directory Users and Computers management console in Managed\
  \ By tab in computer account properties.\n* You might see this event without any\
  \ changes inside, that is, where all Changed Attributes apear as \u201C-\u201C.\
  \ This usually happens when a change is made to an attribute that is not listed\
  \ in the event. In this case there is no way to determine which attribute was changed.\
  \ For example, this would happen if you change the Description of a group object\
  \ using the Active Directory Users and Computers administrative console. Also, if\
  \ the discretionary access control list (DACL) is changed, a 4742 event will generate,\
  \ but all attributes will be \u201C-\u201C.\nImportant: If you manually change any\
  \ user-related setting or attribute, for example if you set the SMARTCARD_REQUIRED\
  \ flag in userAccountControl for the computer account, then the sAMAccountType of\
  \ the computer account will be changed to NORMAL_USER_ACCOUNT and you will get \u201C\
  4738: A user account was changed\u201D instead of 4742 for this computer account.\
  \ Essentially, the computer account will \u201Cbecome\u201D a user account. For\
  \ NORMAL_USER_ACCOUNT you will always get events from Audit User Account Management\
  \ subcategory. We strongly recommend that you avoid changing any user-related settings\
  \ manually for computer objects.\n[MS Source](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/blob/master/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4742.md)\n"
