description: The computer attempted to validate the credentials for an account
details: "This event generates every time that a credential validation occurs using\
  \ NTLM authentication.This event occurs only on the computer that is authoritative\
  \ for the provided credentials. For domain accounts, the domain controller is authoritative.\
  \ For local accounts, the local computer is authoritative.\n* It shows successful\
  \ and unsuccessful credential validation attempts\n* It shows only the computer\
  \ name (Source Workstation) from which the authentication attempt was performed\
  \ (authentication source). For example, if you authenticate from CLIENT-1 to SERVER-1\
  \ using a domain account you will see CLIENT-1 in the Source Workstation field.\
  \ Information about the destination computer (SERVER-1) is not presented in this\
  \ event.\n* If a credential validation attempt fails, you will see a Failure event\
  \ with Error Code parameter value not equal to \u201C0x0\u201D.\n* The main advantage\
  \ of this event is that on domain controllers you can see all authentication attempts\
  \ for domain accounts when NTLM authentication was used.\n* For monitoring local\
  \ account logon attempts, it is better to use event \u201C4624: An account was successfully\
  \ logged on\u201D because it contains more details and is more informative.\n* This\
  \ event also generates when a workstation unlock event occurs.\n* This event does\
  \ not generate when a domain account logs on locally to a domain controller.\n[MS\
