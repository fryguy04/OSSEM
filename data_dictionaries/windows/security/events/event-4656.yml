description: A handle to an object was requested
details: "This event indicates that specific access was requested for an object. The\
  \ object could be a file system, kernel, or registry object, or a file system object\
  \ on removable storage or a device.\nIf access was declined, a Failure event is\
  \ generated.\nThis event generates only if the object\u2019s SACL has the required\

  \ was requested, and the results of the request, but it doesn\u2019t show that the\
