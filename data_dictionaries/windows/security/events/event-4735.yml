description: A security-enabled local group was changed
details: "This event generates every time a security-enabled (security) local group\
  \ is changed.\n* This event generates on domain controllers, member servers, and\
  \ workstations.\n* Some changes do not invoke a 4735 event, for example, changes\
  \ made using Active Directory Users and Computers management console in Managed\
  \ By tab in group account properties.\n* If you change the name of the group (SAM\
  \ Account Name), you also get \u201C4781: The name of an account was changed\u201D\
  \ if \u201CAudit User Account Management\u201D subcategory success auditing is enabled.\n\
  * If you change the group type, you get a change event from the new group type auditing\
  \ subcategory instead of 4735. If you need to monitor for group type changes, it\
  \ is better to monitor for \u201C4764: A group\u2019s type was changed.\u201D These\
  \ events are generated for any group type when group type is changed. \u201CAudit\
  \ Security Group Management\u201D subcategory success auditing must be enabled.\n\
  * From 4735 event you can get information about changes of sAMAccountName and sIDHistory\
  \ attributes or you will see that something changed, but will not be able to see\
  \ what exactly changed.\n[MS Source](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/blob/master/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4735.md)\n"
