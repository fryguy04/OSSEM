description: A Kerberos service ticket was requested
details: "This event generates every time Key Distribution Center gets a Kerberos\
  \ Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket request. This event generates only on domain\
  \ controllers. If TGS issue fails then you will see Failure event with Failure Code\
  \ field not equal to \u201C0x0\u201D. You will typically see many Failure events\
  \ with Failure Code \u201C0x20\u201D, which simply means that a TGS ticket has expired.\
  \ These are informational messages and have little to no security relevance.\n[MS\
