description: A user account was changed
details: "This event generates every time user object is changed.\n* This event generates\
  \ on domain controllers, member servers, and workstations.\n* For each change, a\
  \ separate 4738 event will be generated.\n* You might see this event without any\
  \ changes inside, that is, where all Changed Attributes apear as \u201C-\u201C.\
  \ This usually happens when a change is made to an attribute that is not listed\
  \ in the event. In this case there is no way to determine which attribute was changed.\
  \ For example, if the discretionary access control list (DACL) is changed, a 4738\
  \ event will generate, but all attributes will be \u201C-\u201C.\n* Some changes\
  \ do not invoke a 4738 event.\n[MS Source](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/blob/master/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4738.md)\n"
